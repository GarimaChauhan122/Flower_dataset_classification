Hi :))
The data directory is named flowers.
Here, the model_checkpoint.pth was what i saved by training in the ipynb files.
The model_checkpoint_via_pyfile.pth was what i saved by training in the py files.
You can find the command line arguments in the last line of the code in the py files.
Happy evaluation :))
